# Example config for prettier

Here you can find an example config for prettier.

> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent code style (i.e. code formatting that wonâ€™t affect the AST) across your entire codebase because it disregards the original styling by parsing it away and re-printing the parsed AST with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
